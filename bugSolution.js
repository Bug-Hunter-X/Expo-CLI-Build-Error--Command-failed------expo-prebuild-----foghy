Debugging Steps:

1. **Examine the full error message:** The complete error message, beyond `"Error: Command failed: ... expo prebuild ..."`, provides critical details.  Look for clues about the specific failing step or package.
2. **Check `package.json`:** Inspect your project's `package.json` for:
    * Typos in dependency names.
    * Outdated or incompatible packages.  Use `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to identify outdated packages. 
    * Missing `peerDependencies`.
3. **Run `npm install` or `yarn install`:** Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed.
4. **Update packages:** Try `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update your dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
5. **Update Expo CLI:** Run `expo upgrade` to upgrade to the latest version of the Expo CLI.
6. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes, a clean build can resolve the problem.  Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and then running `npm install` or `yarn install` again.
7. **Check for conflicting packages:** If you use multiple packages with potential version conflicts, carefully inspect their documentation for compatibility information.
8. **Verify native module setup (if applicable):**  Native modules often have their own build processes and requirements. Refer to their documentation for troubleshooting tips.  Make sure the native modules are compatible with your Expo SDK version.
9. **Examine your system:** Ensure your build environment is correctly configured with the necessary tools (Node.js, Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android).
