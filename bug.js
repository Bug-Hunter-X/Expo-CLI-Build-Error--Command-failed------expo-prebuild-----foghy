While building an Expo project, encountering the error: `"Error: Command failed: ... expo prebuild ..."
This often arises from issues within the project's configuration, dependencies, or the Expo CLI itself.  The specific error message following the initial one is crucial for diagnosis.  Common underlying problems include:

* **Incorrect or missing dependencies:**  Check your `package.json` for typos, outdated packages, or missing peerDependencies.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
* **Conflicting packages:** Version mismatches between packages can cause build failures. Examine your `package.json` and try updating packages to their latest compatible versions.
* **Problems with the Expo CLI:**  Ensure you've updated to the latest version of the Expo CLI using `expo upgrade`.
* **Native module issues:** If you're using native modules, they might have configuration or build problems.  Check their respective documentation for any specific instructions or troubleshooting steps.  Ensure the native modules are compatible with your Expo SDK version.
* **Build environment:**  Verify that your system meets the requirements for Expo.  Check for necessary build tools like Node.js, Xcode (for iOS), and Android Studio (for Android).
