# Expo CLI Build Error: Command failed: ... expo prebuild ...

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Expo projects using the Expo CLI: `Error: Command failed: ... expo prebuild ...`.

The error's precise cause varies depending on project configuration, dependencies, and the Expo CLI version.  This repository provides solutions for several common scenarios.

## Common Causes and Solutions:

* **Dependency Issues:** The most frequent cause is problems with project dependencies.  Make sure `npm install` or `yarn install` has successfully installed all dependencies. Check for typos in `package.json` and ensure compatibility between dependency versions.
* **Conflicting Packages:** Version mismatches can lead to build failures. Update packages to compatible versions using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
* **Expo CLI Problems:** Update the Expo CLI to the latest version using `expo upgrade`.
* **Native Modules:** If you use native modules, carefully check their installation and ensure compatibility with your Expo SDK version.
* **Build Environment:**  Confirm your build environment meets Expo's requirements (Node.js, Xcode, Android Studio).
